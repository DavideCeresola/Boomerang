# Game of 15

Game of 15 is a famous board game, where tiles must be sorted from 1 to 15 by switching them with a single empty space.

This example uses a single `UICollectionView` tied to RxBoomerang `RxListViewModel`, embedded animations (thanks RxDataSources! :) ) and a very simple state machine to handle interactions.

## Installation

Ensure you have XcodeGen installed on your machine (`brew install xcodegen`), then launch `xcodegen` and open project.
